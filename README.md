🐍 Intro to Python — A Beginner’s Learning Journey
Hey there! 👋
This is a personal space where I'm learning Python from the ground up — no pressure, no perfection. Just practice, progress, and maybe a few typos along the way. If you're new too, welcome aboard! Let’s figure this out together. 💻✨
🌱 What This Is
This repo is kind of like my Python diary — a bunch of small, beginner-friendly files that cover the basics:
How to write your first Python line
What variables are and why they matter
How to make decisions with if and else
Writing loops without going loopy 🌀
Making your own functions
Playing with lists and dictionaries
Some experiments that may or may not break things (and that’s okay!)
